-- Select queries
--
-- Use the sample SQLite database hr.db
--
-- As a solution to HW, create a file named: task2.sql with all SQL queries:

--      write a query to display the names (first_name, last_name) using alias name "First Name", "Last Name" from the table of employees;
--      write a query to get the unique department ID from the employee table
--      write a query to get all employee details from the employee table ordered by first name, descending
--      write a query to get the names (first_name, last_name), salary, PF of all the employees (PF is calculated as 12% of salary)
--      write a query to get the maximum and minimum salary from the employees table
--      write a query to get a monthly salary (round 2 decimal places) of each and every employee

SELECT first_name as 'First Name', last_name as 'Last Name'
from employees;
SELECT department_id
FROM employees LIMIT 1;
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name DESC;
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, salary * 0.12 as PF
FROM employees;
SELECT MIN(salary) as MIN, MAX(salary) as MAX
FROM employees;
SELECT first_name as 'First Name', last_name as 'Last Name', round(salary / 12, 2) as 'Monthly Salary'
FROM employees;
