"""Task 2

Implement 2 classes, the first one is the Boss and the second one is the Worker.

Worker has a property 'boss', and its value must be an instance of Boss.

You can reassign this value, but you should check whether the new value is Boss. Each Boss has a list of his own
workers. You should implement a method that allows you to add workers to a Boss. You're not allowed to add instances of
Boss class to workers list directly via access to attribute, use getters and setters instead!
